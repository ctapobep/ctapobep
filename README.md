I’ve been doing software development since 2008, and throughout the years I’ve taken roles of Software Engineer/Architect, Project Manager, Business Analyst, AQA. Today I work at [Elsci](https://elsci.io) where we specialize in creating scientific software. We also do B2B [consulting in software development and management](https://elsci.io/business-model.html).

# Software courses

Sometimes articles turn into a series, and then turn into courses. I can read them as part of the B2B consulting or you can go through them on your own:
